Case study of the randomness of numbers and algorithms that generate pseudorandom numbers


=> dados.py | It is an algorithm that analyzes the probability of the sum of N random numbers, in this case N dice are thrown.
This algorithm returns a histogram with the number of time that each sum was drawn.
It is possible to analyze that as the amount of dices is increased, the distribution tends to centralize the values decreasing the randomness.

interesting tests:

Dices: 1
Draws: 50

Dices: 10
Draws: 10000

Dices: 100
Draws: 10000000

Case study of the randomness of numbers and algorithms that generate pseudorandom numbers



=> dados.py | It is an algorithm that analyzes the probability of the sum of N random numbers, in this case N dice are thrown.
This algorithm returns a histogram with the number of times a given number fell.
It is possible to analyze that as the amount of data is increased, the distribution tends to become less random, centralizing the values decreasing the randomness
